# PasswordManager
A simple yet secure Password Manager built with Java Swing and JDBC. It lets users safely store and manage their passwords by encrypting them with AES and hashing using PBKDF2. With an easy-to-use interface, it ensures passwords are protected and can only be accessed through proper verification.
